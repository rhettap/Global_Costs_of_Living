    "So the thing with this data is that it comes from a site called Numbeo. From what little I've read online, this site is not necessarily known for having completely accurate data. There's even a column in the dataset called \"Data quality\" which is a binary value indicating whether or not more data is needed for more accurate results. I just want to note before we dive into this analysis that I wouldn't use this data in a professional setting. I would do a bit more research to get a more accurate/reputable source of data. That being said, I'm still going to use this dataset in my analysis here because I'm really just playing around with what can be done in Tableau as opposed to trying to draw business driving conclusions from the data. \n",

I know the data may not all be entirely accurate and my dashboard was a bit all over the place in terms of what data was being shown, but my overall aim was just to get my hands dirty with Tableau and try out a bunch of things that I've learned in classes I've taken recently. I've been using Tableau in a very basic way for a few years now, but taking a course really opened my mind to all that can be done with the tool. I look forward to playing around a lot more with everything Tableau is capable of doing. Alas, Tableau has dethroned Power BI as my favorite visualization software....for now. Cheers and thanks for stopping by!"
